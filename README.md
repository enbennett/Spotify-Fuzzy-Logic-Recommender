# Spotify-Fuzzy-Logic-Recommender

This system uses a fuzzy logic inference system and user inputs to recommend a short playlist of ten songs. 

Spotify's API is utilized in conjunction with Mamdani logic to recommend based on mood, intensity, and time of day.

The web UI is hosted on Render at the following URL link (note it may take a minute to spin up again if the link has been unactive):
